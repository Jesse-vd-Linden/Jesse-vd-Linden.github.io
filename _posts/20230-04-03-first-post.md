# Introduction

Hello there!

I am Jesse a robotics researcher, studying at TU Delft. In my blog I want to discuss the subjects of Robotics, AI, startups, science and more.

My interest are in decentralized robotics that navigate with the help of computer vision systems and real-time planning methods. And with this the impact new developments will have on industry and what this will mean in the near term.

My blogs will differ from simple coding instructions to political talks around technology. Trying to give new insights weekly

If you are interested in learning more these subjects, follow me for more articles. I will aim to post weekly on medium on a new topic that I have been researching this week.
